<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3"><font color="#FFFFFF">As
an operational mystery lodge within the Western Tradition, the core work of The
Company of Avalon is Ritual Magic . Magic in this context has nothing to
do&nbsp; either with&nbsp; pulling rabbits out of hats or with summoning
&quot;dark forces&quot; for personal gain and power.&nbsp; Magic is a discipline
in consciousness, honed through meditation and empowered in ritual and its
objective is not to gain but to SERVE.&nbsp; Our distinguished predecessor&nbsp;
<a href="the%20Avalonians.htm">Dion Fortune, </a>described
magic as </font><i><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;the</font>  <font color="#FFFFFF">art
of making changes in consciousness in conformity with will&quot;. </font> </i><font color="#FFFFFF">All that said the most
effective injunction that can be given to any budding magician is
&quot;BELIEVE!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Magic may of
course , like any human faculty, be used and abused for self centred and ill
conceived purposes, but any mystery lodge worthy of the name abhors such abuses.
The use of magic in this and similar lodges is <b>in service</b>. But the
essential question is not perhaps &quot;what is magic?&quot; but &quot;WHY
magic?&quot;</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%" align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Magic
can't solve all the world's problems, but it can lay down patterns in
consciousness, individually and universally, which encourage solutions.</font></p>

&nbsp;
MYTHOLOGY</font>
</font>
<p style="line-height: 150%" align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">In
laying down such patterns it forms alliances with, and enlists the co-operation
of, beings who are rarely apparent to&nbsp; normal human perception, hence the
necessity of &quot;making changes in consciousness&quot;. These
&quot;inner&quot; beings with which the magician co-operates may be discarnate
human beings and/or other orders of being, including the denizens of the
Angelic, Faery or Elemental realms. The Western Mystery Tradition describes such
alliances as &quot;inner plane contacts&quot; and rigorously trains and tests
its initiates in the facilitation of such contacts. Mystery lodges who have
established, tested, and are genuinely able to conduct and maintain such inner
dialogue are described as being &quot;contacted&quot;. The Company of Avalon is
such a lodge.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%" align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">This
interaction between flesh and blood human beings and other orders of being is
universally described in the mythologies of all races and nations. Mythology
holds tremendous power and potential in the inner psyche, cultural reflex and
spiritual destiny of a people. Consequently the magician frequently, though not
exclusively, works with an appropriate mythology, to touch the pulse of a race
or nation to initiate inspiration and healing. In the mythological world of ‘what
if’ nothing is written in stone and mechanisms are available to change
things.&nbsp; As to the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of inducing such changes, the
initiate seeks inner validation for his or her actions, underpinned by a strong
sense of ethical and spiritual responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good lodges look for
this in their initiates before entrusting them with the means to unlock
&quot;the door that has no key&quot; &nbsp;</font></p>

SCIENCE</font>
</b>
<p align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Magical techniques for
working in consciousness and tapping inner sources of potential&nbsp; have in
the last seventy years or so, lead some&nbsp; to believe that magic can have
some sort of &quot;scientific&quot; validity,&nbsp; in terms of psychology and,
more recently, in areas of the &quot;new physics&quot; like quantum
mechanics.&nbsp; But magic and science use different tools and functions of
consciousness and consequently speak different languages. Magic must be honest
about this&nbsp; and in this honesty it will find that&nbsp; science can only be
a fellow traveler for some small sections of its journey.&nbsp; It can debate
with science on the effects of human consciousness in Heisenberg’s quantum
worlds of willful waves and particles, but the existence of and a discourse with
other modes of consciousness and being in such worlds is outside the language of
the physicist.&nbsp; Similarly, psychology, particularly Jungian psychology, can
share some common ground with magic, talking about, say, archetypes of the
unconscious. Yet (notwithstanding&nbsp; the psychic experiences and&nbsp;
spiritual inclinations of its founder) Jungian psychology will never permit its
inner archetypes to be anything but facets of flesh and blood human
consciousness.&nbsp; So whilst science grudgingly maintains an uneasy truce with
conventional religion, muttering that theology is not its field, it absolutely
forbids the trespass of other intelligences, even discarnate human
intelligences, into its Quantum realms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;Meanwhile
magic must have Faeries at the bottom of its garden and agree to disagree. The
scientist and the magician do not in any case need each other's approval to do
their respective jobs.&nbsp; Magic can certainly claim&nbsp; &quot;results&quot;
from its endeavours, but those results are generally (if not inevitably)&nbsp;
set in a language which science is reluctant to speak.</span></font>

</b>
<p align="center"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Religion
and magic have a somewhat different, but no less frustrating, relationship.
Magic, as such, is NOT a religion but it may be seen as being a mode of service
which follows on from deeply held spiritual convictions. Without such
convictions (which may or may not be taken from a &quot;religious&quot;
tradition) it tends in any case to lose much of its ethos and integrity.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Institutional&nbsp; &quot;revealed&quot; religions (Christianity, Judaism
, Islam) generally condemn magic, however, seeing it as human meddling in
exclusively &quot;divine&quot; inner things. Much Neo Paganism, by contrast,
tends to blur the boundaries between magical work and religious worship, to (in
our view ) the detriment of both. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>

<table border="1" width="101%" height="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="98%" height="1" rowspan="4"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Making
      changes in consciousness and operating effectively (and ethically) on
      inner levels requires a good deal of training and work and ,from a very
      long time ago, human beings have devised myriad ways of doing this . Most
      magical systems beg steal and borrow their techniques from tradition to
      tradition, modifying their methods in the light of experience within
      changing cultural conditions...with one provisio ...that it works! A good
      example of this is the Qaballistic Tree of Life... originally a glyph of
      Judaic mysticism , subsequently &quot;borrowed&quot; to great effect in
      the practice of both pagan and christian magic. Other patterns include the
      time honoured pentagram and hexagram.&nbsp; Magicians realised from very
      early on that &quot;pictures of patterns&quot; in the form of evocative
      glyphs and symbols are a very good device with which to focus
      consciousness and adjust the levels at which it operates. Consequently you
      will see magical texts appended with all sorts and signs and symbols and
      instructions for the use of these in both meditation and ritual.</font>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Magic uses patterns in sounds
      (words, mantra, music), images, colours, objects, ritual actions and the
      other sensory stimuli (smell=incense for example) to provide inner
      gateways, and the means to nudge consciousness through them.&nbsp; In
      ancient (and some surviving ) ethnic cultures natural hallucinogens were
      also employed, but for a number of reasons these are no longer either
      advisable or necessary.... nor indeed workable beyond the tribal context
      of the cultures in which they were originally used.&nbsp; Mythology ,
      however, remains a rich and powerful source of magical stimulation, in
      that its powers and scenarios&nbsp; provide&nbsp; well trodden inner
      routes into the collective consciousness of specific cultures. All these
      are utilised in a focused, systematic way to build bridges between the
      inner and outer worlds. In this magic can be both a mode of service and a
      means of personal realisation and transformation. Rightly understood these
      two facets of magic, personal realisation and service, are two sides of
      the same coin.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What is frequently forgotten,
      however, is that these inner /outer bridges are very much a&nbsp;
      &quot;two way street&quot;...they have to be for the magic to
      &quot;work&quot; !&nbsp; This is especially apparent in ritual work,
      where&nbsp; specifically focused visualisation is combined with sensory
      stimuli, invocation and and physical actions to provide, as it were, the
      incarnate &quot;earth&quot; end of such a bridge. This facilitates, with
      meditational preparation and planning, a conduit for inner power to have
      credence in the physical world.&nbsp;To achieve such a focus magic is
      worked within defined parameters. The &quot;circle of art&quot; so beloved
      by occult novelists, is more usually known by magicians as &quot;Sacred
      Space&quot; and defines a specific area, a spherical pattern in time,
      space and consciousness within which the work is undertaken. In group work
      this area is physically defined in the horizontal circle of participants
      who generally sit or stand in a ring around a central altar in a lodge
      room or temple . This same definition of &quot; a place set apart&quot; as
      an area of focus where the inner and outer worlds may interact is apparent
      in prehistoric &quot;sacred sites&quot; such as Bronze Age stone circles.
      Many of these, not only define a sacred area but&nbsp; carry in their
      geometry, construction and alignments, sympathetic and symbolic
      associations with the magical work once done there. In modern ritual work
      areas of the circle/sacred space are defined by and associated with
      directions, seasons, elements through &quot;magical weapons&quot;,
      typically the sword, wand, cup and disk which make the appropriate visual
      and tactile associations. In this the quarters of the circle define
      specific gates between the inner and outer worlds with selected
      individuals being responsible for mediating the powers that move through
      these gates.&nbsp; Whilst this very rarely results in the physical
      manifestation of &quot;spirits&quot;, as described in the questionable
      &quot;grimoires&quot; of mediaeval magic, its effects can certainly be
      felt. Normally these feelings are uplifting, enlightening and life
      enhancing, but as magic is a discipline in consciousness, its results are
      very much coloured by the will and intention of its operatives...what you
      have in mind, is very much reflected in what you get !</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">All magical ritual work must be
      constantly supported by individual meditation....the serious magician
      builds and elaborates his or her personal bridges to the inner worlds on a
      daily basis and, in doing so also monitors his or her own will and motive.
      All magicians , whether members of groups or not, have to learn to work
      alone in a responsible and effective way. Some elect to ONLY work alone,
      and our course of training caters for both the lone magician and those who
      want to go on to work in this or other groups.</font></p>
