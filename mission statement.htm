Company of Avalon is a contacted branch of the Western Mystery Tradition. Our
name is taken from the contacts behind that branch of the tradition which is
sometimes called <i>Avalonian. </i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Avalon
signifies the archetypal inner Britain that provides a spiritual template not
only for these islands, but for all that has in history and legend touched these
shores. The word <i>Avalon</i> itself derives from a Celtic concept expressed
through the Welsh word <i>Afallen </i>meaning apple tree, a universal,
mythological theme for a sometime paradisal, inner state.&nbsp;<o:p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:0cm" align="center">We seek to serve the folk
soul of these islands and in consequence all that folk soul has touched from
antiquity to the new world. To do this we believe that we must not only aspire
to the heights of heaven but also enter the ancient deep. For we further believe
that in this may be found a true understanding of Soul, of Self, of the many
dimensions with which we share creation, and of the creator, by whatever name.
Accordingly, our work encompasses both the pagan and Judeo-Christian mysteries,
that is, the mysteries of the Great Goddess and the good earth, as well as the
Christian ethos and the mythos of the Holy Grail. For Avalon represents a
drawing together of the many and diverse sacred threads embodied in all the
great mystery traditions of the west.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly">The
apparent gathering together of many of those threads in the ancient southwest of
England has created a tendency for Avalon to be solely associated with
Glastonbury. As the historical focus of the happy collision of so many mystery
traditions in one location, Glastonbury certainly enshrines a unique spiritual
history. Ancient spirituality has hung in the airs of the place from the early
Bronze Age through the Romano-Celtic epoch. This carried through in its
fostering of British Christianity and the subsequent pagan-Christian hybrid of
the Arthurian and Grail myths, the latter of which incorporated motifs of
mystical Islam. Indeed the drawing together of so many sacred themes from these
ancient seeds at Glastonbury is in itself<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>an
essential feature of the concept we call <i>Avalon</i>. Consequently Glastonbury
has become the place where the British folk soul, and the folk souls of more
recent nations that sprang from it, have so often felt closest to their
spiritual roots. Down the centuries a succession of priests and priestesses,
saints, mystics and teachers, both pagan and Christian, have nurtured those
roots and endowed Glastonbury as “the holiest earthe in England.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly">In
the early twentieth century, Glastonbury experienced an influx of people who
have since been called <i>Avalonians</i>, including such celebrated esotericists
as Dion Fortune, William Sharp, Wellesley Tudor Pole, and Frederick Bligh Bond.
Bond was himself influenced by a medieval <i>Company of Avalon</i>, a group of
seemingly discarnate monks from Glastonbury Abbey. Through automatic writing,
they revealed to him the esoteric secrets hidden within its archaeology. It is
from the work of William Sharp, Bligh Bond, and especially Dion Fortune that
this present Company of Avalon has evolved. Both Mike Harris and Steve Blamires,
as initiates of this present lodge, stand in direct descent from the magical
fraternity founded by Dion Fortune at Glastonbury. Yet Avalon is essentially an
inner place, to which no person or physical place may lay especial claim.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly"><i>Afallen,</i>
the Welsh word from which <i>Avalon</i> perhaps derives, may be found in the <i>Afallenau</i>
poems which were collated, along with other verses, in the thirteenth century <i>Black
Book of Carmarthen.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These poems
describe the experiences of Mirddyn (Merlin) in what is now the Scottish
lowlands of Celyddon, and seem to allude to the prophetic gifts of the Avalon
inner state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Parallel Welsh sources
in the <i>Mabinogi </i>and <i>Taliesin</i> literature also mention Arthur and
Gwyn ap Nudd (both later associated with Glastonbury) and journeys into the
underworld of <i>Annwn</i>. But the concept of Arthur and Annwn and of
Merlin’s related inner place of Avalonian apple trees and prophecy almost
certainly reflect a lost mythological tradition common to the pre-Celtic peoples
of these islands – and even their contemporaries in the ancient Mediterranean
world – long before they were written down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly">Essential
to Merlin’s and Arthur’s otherworld experiences is the mediation of feminine
powers, who often appear in this literature as Faerie women with now familiar
names like Guinevere, the Lady of the Lake, Morgen, Ceridwen and Arianrhod. Each
of these, and others, display the otherworld characteristics of a <i>Gwraig
Annwn</i> (partner of the deep) from Welsh mythology. Their teaching, healing
and, ultimately, transformative roles embody the very <i>raison d’etre</i> of
Avalon. Perhaps the most redoubtable of these was Brighid, pagan goddess and
Celtic Christian saint, in which latter role she became an integral part of the
Glastonbury mythology. For a western civilisation whose spirituality is still
overshadowed by the institutions of patriarchal religion, this conceptualisation
of the divine feminine provides, as it has always done, a necessary
counter-balance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly">Such
factors serve to show that whilst The Company of Avalon attributes due reverence
to both Glastonbury and earlier “Celtic” expression of this concept in the
ancient west, it is the timeless, yet currently relevant, understanding of
Avalon as an inner state which we seek to mediate, rather than specific times or
places in its illustrious history.

objectives are <i>mystical</i>, but the means by which we seek to achieve them
are <i>magical</i>. We therefore pursue the disciplines of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>contemplation and meditation and seek their expression through the
working of ritual magic. We also aim to train others in these disciplines, which
necessitate an understanding of such varied subjects as Star Lore, Qabalah,
Sacred Geometry, Divination, Astrology and Spiritual Alchemy as well as the
study of our native, Celtic spirituality and magic, and the mythology which
underpins its practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Avalon
tradition is, as we have stated, a drawing together of many threads, from
Angelic to Faery, from Arthurian to “Atlantean”, from Celtic to ancient
Egyptian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this it may resemble
Celtic knot-work, but for all that, it is by no means exclusively “Celtic”.
Since prehistoric times, the British folk soul has both borrowed from and
informed other mythologies and cultures. The great mystery religions of the
ancient Middle East provide but one example of this. We seek to make this
universality clear in both our own practice and in the instruction of our
students.</p>

of relevant traditions for what we consider to be their spiritual merit, not
their exoteric dogma. We believe, for example that distinction needs to be drawn
between, on the one hand, the ethos and mythos of “revealed” religion
(Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and the patriarchal dogmas that these faiths seek
to impose. Equally, we would point to the distinctions between native pagan
spirituality and magic, and the dogmas and prejudices of modern neo-paganism.
The Mysteries, rightly understood, enlist what is of value to spiritual
evolution and have no place for the limiting negatives, neo-pagan, Christian or
other, which dogma implies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

Company of Avalon is structured upon the traditional format of most
“contacted” lodges in the Western Mystery Tradition. It must however be said
that such structures should be regarded in the light of their suitability for
service, and as with all temporal human institutions, are not be viewed as being
forever set in stone. The willingness to adapt to inner initiatives must always
be paramount for any lodge which claims to be “contacted”. Contacted lodges
are those who operate inner-outer alliances and who, through inner co-operation,
are deemed competent to conduct relevant magical work, and to instruct and
initiate others for that work’s continuance.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly">Lodges
are ruled by a Magus or Magi, who must be initiates of the “Greater
Mysteries”. The Magus of a lodge has overall responsibility for all magical
work and instruction, and he or she is the ultimate arbiter in any matters of
policy, dispute or discipline<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Greater
Mystery initiates are those who, in the nomenclature of the mysteries, have
reached the standing of Adeptus Minor or above. Such initiates carry forward a
“magical lineage”, generally from the earlier lodges, which trained and
initiated them. Both Mike Harris and Steve Blamires can claim such a lineage
through their own initiator, who received his initiation from the Society of the
Inner Light. That Society was founded by Dion Fortune, after her own initiation
in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The present Magus of this Lodge is
Mike Harris.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
