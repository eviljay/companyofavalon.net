<p align="CENTER">at Glastonbury</p>
<p align="CENTER">2nd September 2006</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">We are met in the 60<sup>th</sup>
year after the death of Dion Fortune. So much of her life is a matter of record
that I have wanted to look for some unturned stone, so I have chosen to look at
her work through the patterns of the life blueprint in her natal horoscope. I
have used the methods of both traditional astrology and Fixed Star astrology.
Fixed Star astrology is more ancient and less familiar, it is a system which
does not use the more recently discovered planets and provides its own method of
analysis which will be described in more detail as we meet it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">I can still remember
the moment when Dion Fortune came into my life, I was 14. As a precious reader
with far too strong an interest in the occult to be normal, I was already
working my way along the occult bookshelf at the adult library when I found a
copy of <i>The Cosmic Doctrine, </i>I thought it was wonderful and when it was
due back I renewed it again, and again and again….. I wondered about the name
Dion Fortune - well surely no-one could be born with a name like that – and of
course she wasn’t. With the certainty that one should share a good thing, I
even tried to get my father to read it – not a good idea – &quot;What kind
of name is this?&quot; – &quot;Some made up nonsense that’s for
certain,&quot; - and he suggested I use my mind more profitably.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">This brief incident
was indeed a microcosmic moment. I had found DF by chance aged 14, but as we
know, so many such moments are not chance but the hand of some unseen destiny at
work. Not only did I find the book but as I read the words- understanding
opened. Somewhere deep inside me, I recognized this language. I wrestled with
the concepts in <i>The Cosmic Doctrine </i>when I was 14 not realizing that
other better, older more mature minds were also wresting with the same text as
it formed part of the teaching material for the Society of the Inner Light .</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">When the book spoke
of an inner communicator, a light went on in my head: it all seemed perfectly
sensible to me. My father’s reaction showed me something that took me a lot
longer to really grasp - his response was genuinely representative of the
majority view. He tried to read it- he could not understand what it was trying
to say – he did not speak this language, and nor did the vast majority of
people. This was an esoteric book – a work for the few - the many would be
doing much more interesting things. What I took to be a fascinating text most
worthy of my mind’s work, my father as representative of the group mind took
to be a waste of time. What I wanted to share, my father dismissed - and here in
this little capsule, was exactly what the soul who came into incarnation 6th
December 1890 - would have to face on a grand scale- how might a dismissive
group mind, deaf to esoteric vocabulary be awakened.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">There is no doubt in
my mind that the soul charged with the purpose of waking a generation, was
already aligned with the work of the hierarchy. Taking incarnation on the 6<sup>th</sup>
December at Llandudno provided a natal horoscope equipped with the tools for the
job. Turning first to Fixed Star astrology, (which does not require the exact
moment of birth), we find new insights on offer. This analysis begins with</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">the stars which rise
and set on the day of birth. The Rising Star, recently returned from the
Underworld, brings gifts from the land of the past, the family and ancestral
genetics. The Setting Star just returned from the realm of the Immortals, brings
gifts from the soul, private goals, motivations, and the silent name of the
personal spiritual pathway represents the doorway between the worlds and holds
the template of destiny.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In DF’s chart the
Heliacal Rising Star is Spica. Establishing a tone for the entire chart, Spica,
as the 14<sup>th</sup> brightest in the sky brings its special theme, laying the
foundation for a personal philosophy and setting the course for a vocation as
yet unrealised. Holding this significant office, this star is a gift, a jewel
entrusted at birth from ancestral genetics and family line: DF’s mother was a
Christian Scientist, a trance medium and registered healer, family friends
included Kitty Pole, who along with her sister discovered the Glastonbury Cup in
1907, Kitty’s close friend Alice Buckton who later purchased Chalice Well in
1912 and Maiya Curtis-Webb (later to become Maya Tranchell-Hayes) of the Alpha
and Omega temple.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Entitled A Gift from
the Goddess, the star Spica brings the desire to use one's talents for the
greatest possible good. This star shines in the wheat-sheaf carried by the
maiden goddess, Virgo. Her gift is an earthy practical knowledge of cultivation
and all its attendant skills and gifts. Spica brings gifts of harvest and bounty
to humanity. Nowadays, it is easy to overlook the cultural significance of such
basic necessities, but so fundamental were grain, bread, wheat and wheat in the
psyche of our forebears that these everyday commodities acquired symbolic
meaning as the staff of life. At the Mysteries of Eleusis, it is strongly
suggested the ultimate initiating revelation of immortal life was conveyed
through the sacred showing of an ear of wheat. DF came into incarnation bearing
the gifts of Spica, the wheatsheaf. This is a star which shows a potential for
brilliance, an innate talent, skill or ability which is out of the ordinary. It
is the mark of a gifted person who truly does have something to contribute to
the world, through a talent or an insight that may be quite special.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The Rising Star is
partnered by the Heliacal Setting Star which brings the gift of personal destiny
from the Immortals. For DF, the star, Alcyone in the Pleaides held this office.
The contemporary astrologer Bernadette Brady calls this The Third Eye and
describes it’s purpose as To Seek Inner Knowledge. But at the same time she
also describes the nature of Alcyone as The Mystic that can be Ruthless. Alcyone
brings a strong, indeed an inescapable desire to seek inner knowledge. Its
placement indicates that personal identity will be tied to strong spiritual and
visionary needs and will be expressed through artistic and creative avenues.
Linked to the Fates and the judgement of the dead, Alcyone can also manifest as
ruthlessness when dealing with those who have not met certain standards.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">DF’s Ascendant
lies in Virgo and is in conjunction with the Moon – the placement is entitled
Unconscious Attunement. The fusion of these two energies brings deep
appreciation of the power of the unconscious and of instinctual behaviour.
Square to Mercury, this challenging placement to the Ascendant is called The
Messenger. It brings talents in the field of information and communication. This
placement perfectly equips the role of the Messenger with natural intelligence
and the desire to be informed and up-to-date on all the latest developments.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In relationship to
Jupiter, the Ascendant simultaneously brings a placement called The Counsellor.
Not interested in trivia, but seeking some kind of overall meaning, this
placement brings an expansion into philosophical horizons and an ability to
understand in depth the things that move people’s lives. This placement points
to recognised success and the ability to exert considerable influence through
the power of unusual opinions and good judgement. Moreover this placement
indicates a larger than life character with strong views on most issues and a
deep interest in spiritual issues.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">DF’s
accomplishments and real life struggles can be set against the outline of this
blueprint: emerging from latent potentiality to become physical actuality. She
became The Counsellor and The Messenger. She drew upon her special giftedness, a
natural understanding of the unconscious and aligned herself with the inner
compulsion to explore spiritual issues. She came to embody the image of the
figure bearing a wheatsheaf; she seeded a magical current and brought a
plentiful cornucopia in the barren wastelands of the twentieth century.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Born in 1890 DF was
not typical of her generation: a free spirit interested in psychology when it
was a new science, interested in hypnotherapy when it was in its infancy,
interested in occultism when it was hidden. The society in which she grew up was
rigid, hidebound, class conscious, puritanical, orthodox, conservative, immune
from outside spiritual influences and straightacketed by religious
conventionality. It was her self appointed task to plant the seeds of a
spiritual revolution, to seed the subconscious mind of the race with
possibilities. This was her destiny, the promise offered in her own natal
blueprint. She allows one of her her fictional characters to say:</font></p>
<i>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">It was my task to
bring certain new concepts to the mind of the race, not to the conscious mind,
but to its subconscious mind and this is done by living them, it was not my task
to lecture or write or appear in the public eye as is done by those who speak to
the conscious mind of the race. (1)</font></p>
<font face="Papyrus">
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"></font></i><font size="4">Of course
DF lectured, wrote and to an extent appeared in the public eye but this same
goal of seeding change would not be accomplished except through much more subtle
means, not information but invocation. Politicians and law makers bring change
consciously by working visibly in society but DF was to seed another revolution
altogether. Working behind the scenes of society in the engine room of the group
mind, she recalibrated the system from within. This is the role of the adept.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Returning to the
natal horoscope once more, Fixed Star analysis provides a new perspective by
assigning stars to three periods of life. Accordingly in youth, DFwas blessed by
the star Antares called, The Heart of the Scorpion. This is the Royal Star of
Persia and is associated with the god of the dead. Known as The Watcher of the
West - curiously a title that might suit DF remarkably well, its alignment with
the Sun in her chart brings intensity, focused and the determination to complete
a task. Its downside brings the potential to be obsessed, to seek drama for its
own sake, to arouse intensity even when it is not required and to go to
extremes, intentionally or unintentionally; the stuff of power games walks hand
in hand with the gifts of the royal star. It brings success, worldly or
otherwise through the generation of a cleansing life-and-death experience –
the classic initiatory sequence. It also carries the power to see the dark and
the light of situations, to see the God and the Devil in things, and in this
manner produces strong reactions in others polarising their support either for
or against.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Also in the period
of her youth DF was blessed by the star Castor, one of the twins of Gemini,
Castor and Pollux. Aligned with Mars, Castor as the dominant active star in DF’s
youth brings the capacity to favour the bright side of the story or situation.
The twins together represent the universal play of cosmic polarity, a theme
which was to loom large in DF’s thinking. Castor singly brings the gifts of
planning, of thinking, of solving problems mentally. It brings a love of mental
challenge, the mental knot, the puzzle, even the crossword and a mind designed
for investigation and research. According to Bernadette Brady, the eternal
struggle between life’s polarities enacted by the twin stars of Gemini, Castor
and Pollux, produces writers, most especially the story-teller who blends good
and evil, over-lapping them with until both are changed and both are whole.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The final star to
have a place in DF’s youthful period is Sualocin, also called Rotanev. Aligned
with the Sun it brings skills in a particular field. As the alpha star of the
Dolphin, it represents a kind of intelligent playfulness, which is also mastery,
and confidence in the environment. (Curiously its discoverer was also playful,
he named the star after <i>Nicolaus</i> <i>Venator</i>, an assistant and
successor to the Italian astronomer Guiseppe Piazzi, but he reversed the letters
of the name and hugely enjoyed the private joke as generations struggled to
pronounce the unpronouncable !!</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Not one of the
strong stars, ‘Nicolaus reversed ’ acts in support of other more important
players. But its gifts of physical talent, vitality and above all curiosity
about one's environment, can be directed towards other specific aims and goals.
Belonging to the early developmental period, this star influences childhood, but
since it is also signified in the prime period, its second appearance suggests
that attitude, hobby, or passion from childhood is carried and matured into
adult life.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The influences of
the two significant stars from the youthful period became visible as the natal
pattern unfolded in real life. Her writing was first published 1906 when</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">she was 16. But DF
was to go onto greater things. Not only did she became the storyteller but she
turned an esoterically trained eye to national story, our Arthurian legacy and
in doing so seeded a cultural and spiritual movement which still inspires. Story
holds the template of our deepest and most inaccessible patterning held in
mythic themes. DF was among the first to explore this mythic territory as
spiritual blueprint by unfolding its inner vistas so that others might share in
the vision too. It is not surprising that in her quest to seed the group mind
with new ideas, DF chose to present esoteric truths through story, knowing that
this is a certain pathway into the group mind and a direct route into the vast
storehouse of living energies that make up the collective mind. Written with
deliberate intent, a prerequisite for any magical act, the novels were designed
to speak, ‘<i>directly to the subconscious by the method of imagery, which is
the only</i> <i>language the subconscious understands</i>.’ (2) Not only did
DF write for the subconscious but she wrote from the subconscious, ‘<i>my
novels … they are not written they are lived and recorded. Everything is seen
and heard as exactly as if I were watching a play at the theatre. </i>(3) This
kind of engagement should be familiar, it is the stock in trade of creative
consciousness, a detached witnessing part of the mind as a drama unfolds beyond
its remit<i>. </i>Quite where that drama originates might be open to question,
as part of the individualised mind or as part of the greater mind reflected
locally. Nevertheless this experience is commonplace arising in both meditation
and imaginative creation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Occult fiction
served as a vehicle for the same concepts that also appeared in the didactic
works but allowed the reader more freedom to consider such ideas while being
carried along with the narrative. Her characters: Ursula Brangwyn, and her
brother, Ted Murchison, Hugh Paston, Mona Freeman, Victoria Mainwering,</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Rupert Malcom and
Wilfred Maxwell were the spokespersons for her ideas.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">&quot;<i>I am
interested in the remoter branches of psychology,&quot;</i> says Brangwyn in The
Winged Bull. (4)</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">He continues, <i>&quot;There
are a lot of things in the subconscious than are dreamed of by our mutual friend
Dr. Freud.&quot; </i>(5)</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Ursula says, <i>&quot;My
brother thinks that there was a great deal more in the old pagan faiths than is
generally realized and he is investigating them from the psychological point of
view.&quot; </i>(6)</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">And Brangwyn asks: <i>Did
you ever hear of the tradition of lost Atlantis?&quot; </i>(7)</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">DF used the novel
format as a display case for occult ideas. Her many interrelated themes,
reincarnation and karmic consequence, pagan deities gods, sexual repression and
ancient mysteries were invariably wrapped in a single package: that of magical,
sexual and magnetic polarity between a man and a woman serving as priest and
priestess. She endowed this singular polarity with a romantic potency which is
probably unattainable in reality. Nevertheless, she was without stating it,
introducing eastern concepts of Tantric worship to a western audience still
recovering from Victorian ideas of sexual modesty. In The Winged Bull, she</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">says of the rite
performed Ursula and Ted Murchison :</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">‘<i>That was all
there was of it upon the physical plane but inwardly there was much more going
on. They were two forces, not two persons, he was the sun in heaven bringing
life to the earth. She was the earth absorbing it hungrily.’ (8</i>)</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">DF understood the
importance of the imagination for both the occult student and the engaged
reader. Knowing that readers lives out a good story in the imagination, she
deftly included several invocations, perhaps silently inviting the reader, ‘to
have a go’ just like the characters in the fiction. She dropped in real
techniques, innocuous to the innocent but primed to trigger the curious. In the
Winged Bull Brangwyn says to Ted :</font></p>
<i>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">‘Put the palms of
your hands against hers and enter into it imaginatively.</font></i><font size="4">
(9) – an innocent enough invitation but one designed to awaken the circuits of
magnetic polarity that DF hinted at so often. With a throw-away line, DF told
the reader what to expect: ‘a <i>tingling in his palms and a sense of growing
warmth that was spreading slowly all over him.’ (10</i>)</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">She drew the reader
into these imaginary worlds with deliberate intent and skilled use of words,
both precipitating and expecting an emotional response from the reader, <i>‘in
proportion to his powers of imagination and his sympathy with the divine
character portrayed.’ </i>(11) This oblique, open ended, permissive approach
as any hypnotherapist knows, permits the reader to respond freely and
personally. Her weaving of familiar real places and utterly unfamiliar ideas as
a single tapestry was a bold act creative act. She included genuine occult
practices, trance work, the assumption of the god-forms, establishing the sacred
space and included invocations and even scripted magical rituals. It might be
said however that such fictionalised occult endeavour was glamourised,
consciously or unconsciously belying its real life counterpart. Nevertheless the
charm worked, the novels are still in print and they still fascinate</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The DF’ novels
followed in the same tradition as the classical Golden Ass by Apuleius, in her
own words, <i>‘in fact each story is the story of an initiation’. </i>(12)
As DF of course knew, sacred drama and magical story are natural bedfellows. So
she presented the eternal intiatiatory themes: suffering, death and resurrection
in the palatable twentieth century form of the novel, thereby replacing actual
physical ritual with empathic imagined identification without which no
initiation can succeed. Indeed it is the ability of the candidate to identify
with the central divine person which precipitates the ‘profound emotional
experience.’ <i>‘This empathic quality, alive and well in receptive persons,
will produce something of the same results as are produced by the experience of
going through a ritual initiation’ </i>(13 ) - a mighty claim and exalted
aspiration for occult fiction.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The three novels <i>The Winged Bull, The Sea
Priestess and the Goat Foot God, </i>individually and together present the
reader with initiatory themes - in fact with the imaginative encounter of an
initiatory experience. In this seemingly innocuous manner, DF as adept wrote to
inspire, intrigue, inform and ultimately precipitated the mass initiation of a
generation. DF said, ‘ <i>I have tried to make use of the dramatic form as a
vehicle for mystical and cosmic interpretation.’ </i>(14)</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The star Castor not
only gifts storytelling but it also brings a love of mental challenge, in the
form of puzzle and riddle. DF was therefore perfectly equipped even destined to
face up to the challenge of the Qabalah, the ultimate secret symbolic code. In
her classic book <i>The Mystical Qabalah,</i> DF took the heart of a closed
mystical system and brought it lovingly to a different audience. She even linked
the intellectual content of it with the imaginative content of the novels being
both storyeller and codebreaker. Each of the novels was expressly related to a
single Sephiroth on the Tree of Life; <i>The Winged Bull </i>to Tiphareth, <i>The
Sea Priestess </i>to Yesod and <i>The Goat Foot God </i>to Malkuth. The
intellectual structure of <i>The Mystical Qabalah </i>coupled with the
imaginative engagement of the novels, served to awaken the intuitive perception
of the reader.<i> </i>This dual thrust was quite deliberate. She wrote, <i>The
'Mystical Qabalah' gives the theory, but the novels give the practice. … Those
who study the Mystical Qabalah with the help of the novels get the keys of the
Temple put into their hands.</i> (15)</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The seeds planted in the phase of
her youth, the mental agility bestowed by the star Castor, the focus and
intensity gifted by Antares were carried by the star of The Dolphin to mature in
the fullness of time and life. Together the initiating novels and her specific
teaching works together formed a comprehensive corpus. Where the teaching texts
gave explanations the novels immersed the reader in new experience, soaking the
imagination and feeding the subconscious in magical correspondences.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Of all the novels,
DF is surely best remembered for <i>Moon Magic </i>. When I first read it many
years ago, it sent my mind spinning, its images haunted me like some half
remembered dream. Occultists, by virtue of their trade, do much to cross the
threshold between levels of consciousness. DF was especially gifted in this way
but she was not immune from the unpredictable nature of the imaginative toolbox.
The subconscious as Freud, Jung and DF knew is a potent place, both a storehouse
of forgetting and a reservoir of psychic energy. ‘<i>My subconscious as all
subconscionsess must, contains a great deal more than I realised was there till
it rose to the surface in the course of the writing.’ </i>(16)<i> </i>In the
introduction, she said, <i>‘I wrote it to find out what it was about.’ </i>So
if the novel appeared more by way of an extended automatic writing in surrender
to the subconscious, it should be no surprise that in DF’s psyche there lurked
a powerful constellation of female authority and magic. Whether by imaginative
creation, artistic inspiration, or the power of evocation, Lilith Le Fay made
her presence known. Whatever its source, wherever it originated, DF’s most
enigmatic compilation, alter- ego, possibly even separate identity, spoke as the
antidote to the acceptable role for women in the early twentieth century. She
voiced sentiments that must surely have echoed in DF’s own life :</font></p>
<i>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">‘The law by which
I live is so strange.’ </font></i><font size="4">(17)</font></p>
<i>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">‘Those of whom
come in thus have been trained and made in a previous life and I have always
been a priestess of the great mother.’ </font></i><font size="4">(18)</font></p>
<i>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">‘So I came back to the world once
again as the priestess of the great goddess bringing with me the memory of
forgotten arts, one of which is the art of being a woman. I came because I was
sent. There was that needed that which I had to give.’ </font></i><font size="4">(19)</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">It was in <i>Moon
Magic </i>that the earlier themes of reincarnation, karmic consequence and
magical polarity were indelibly stamped. Incomplete at her death, it arose from
the Isis workings she conducted during that period and it was in fact completed
only after her death through mediumship. Although the book contains no
historically accurate descriptions of Isis worship, DF succeeded in powerfully
glamorising her audience through magical invocation and the evocation of the
Black Isis, the Prima Materia, the Great Mother, Binah in her dark underground
temple. It is no wonder that some contemporaries thought she had said too much,
revealed too much Moon Magic in its pages.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">These deliberate
transgressions were all part of DF’s pioneering spirit. Like any physical
pioneer in a new land, she was redoutable and tough minded. With the star Phact
- The Bow of the Argo aligned to The Cross of Matter (Ascendent, Descendent, MC.
and IC.) in her natal horoscope this should be no surprise. This star used to be
part of the Argo, on the top of the bow, crashing through the waves in waters
uncharted. It brings the gift of risk taking and of exploration in new realms
which so characterised her life’s work. This willingness to take risks is
exemplified in the novels by her choice of theme. She wrote repeatedly about
reincarnation and its karmic consequences when such ideas still held shock
value. She wrote about the misery of a dutiful but empty and marriage at a time
when divorce held a stigma. She wrote about the empowerment of women long before
feminism and introduced the persona of a priestess when most women were happily
engaged with knitting patterns and behind everything, the spirit of Atlantis
lurked. These were her chosen themes, her carefully placed seeds that were
skilfully planted not by great intellectual discourse and analysis but neatly
and deftly woven into fanciful stories of everyday life and magic</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">As youthfulness
faded and DF moved into the prime of her life, so she came under the influence
of Aculeus - One of the Stings of the Scorpion. Aculeus and its partner Acumen,
form the tail of Scorpio. Aculeus brings the sting of the scorpion as verbal,
mental or even spiritual attack Aligned with Mercury, the god of business,
contracts, paperwork and communication, its placement indicates voices raised in
opposition, behind the scenes talk even gossip. DF was no stranger to
controversy – her spats with Moina Mathers are well documented. But Aculeus
brings the kind of irritation which serve only strengthen resolve and
determination. As a weapon is hardened in fire, so this endurance tempers the
mind and provides the staying power to tackle hard intellectual subjects and
face real challenges presented by writing and communication. The influence of
this star comes from the very foundations of personal life, from family history
and curiously from, ‘the roots of the tree of your life.’</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">DF was well equipped
mentally for her task: Mercury in Sagittarius provided an extremely active
mentality, with the desire to seek new mental horizons and a delight in learning
for its own sake. Entitled, Inspire Others, this placement needs variety,
movement and intellectual challenges. Placed in the third house, Mercury here
brings a constant desire to learn, to expand mental horizons and create contacts
with people. Communication and teaching are of paramount importance, the
placement called, Gather and Disseminate Knowledge brings natural secretarial
abilities and an ability gift for putting ideas across. Such mental prowess of
course can be quite intimidating to others not as blessed. Diplomacy does not
come naturally for someone with a strong opinion on anything on everything
however. The star Aculeus added a new dimension to her already powerful mind she
did endure the sting of the scorpion – the vengeful words of others and an
extra ability to face intellectual rigour was surely channelled into the
challenge of </font><i><font size="4">The Mystical Qabalah.</font></p>
</i>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The second star
significated during her prime is Betelgeuse, called The Right Shoulder of the
God, this is one of the great stars of the sky and it brings unbridled victory
without complications. Betelgeuse is effective, brilliant and successful. As the
right hand, or shoulder of the god, the star represents that which is clear and
strong. Aligned with the Moon, in her horoscope, Betelgeuse, brings the
qualities of caring, compassion and empathy. This placement belongs to An
Empowered Person who is Concerned with the Quality of Life. It brings emotional
fulfilment as the fruit of personal labour to help others or the environment.
Betelegeuese brings a rare gift, the ability to make a difference, either it
locally or globally.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">DF also received the
influence of the star Capulus during her prime. This is the Sword of the
Warrior, its alignment with Mars only serves to intensify its nature. This
nebula is identified with male sexual energy: focused, direct, and penetrating
in action. Its energy is clear and decisive at times, brutal and even violent.
Understandably this is considered to be one of the most difficult stars in a
natal chart. In DF’s natal chart the star is Circumpolar never touching the
earth. This places the star’s influence at a high spiritual level. DF had no
hesitation wielding The Sword of Perseus in defence of the nations and its
allies. She joined the war effort and the weekly letters sent out to students
stand on record. She wrote, <i>The initiation of the Sphere of Geburah is that
of Aeptus Major only one of the</i> <i>greater adepts can use the power of the
sword and unless he can use it, he is not a</i> <i>great adept, the world cannot
be ruled by love alone. </i>(20) DF was well equipped in all ways to wield the
sword and through the shred meditations of her group, she did so with the words:
<i>When wielding the sword of Geburah gaze into the shield of Hermes and not
upon the face of the adversary. …………It is well to rely upon the methods
of Perseus and let the sandals of swiftness keep you out of harms way by virtue
of the penetrative power of thought which discerns the directions of the attack
and evades it. </i>(21)</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Wielding the sword
of the warrior, the power of Capulus, DF wrote - <i>‘there is a grade of
initiation wherein the initiate must enter the sphere of Geburah and abide
therein and learn its lessons and the less of Geburah there is in him, the
longer he must abide there. There are times of crises and emergency when even
those who have passed on to the sphere of mercy may be recalled to man the
ramparts of Geburah. </i>(22)</font><i></p>
</i>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Her words are
recorded in the book, <i>‘ Dion Fortune - The Magical Battle of Britain. </i>This
book serves as a powerful testament to her work and beliefs. Written to her
students not members of the public and without the glamour of the novels; these
war letters are a mine of occult wisdom.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In DF’s natal
chart, Mars played an important role providing drive and energy for her many
activities. DF was naturally endowed with the warrior mentality. Quite apart
from the star Capulus, Mars Trine to the MC is also called The Warrior.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">This aligns personal
power to purpose and gives the ability to eat up conflict on the way to the top.
It also provides a robust even aggressive attitude whenever needed. Mars in
Aquarius is called Create Tomorrow Today – which she did.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In complete contrast
to such abundant male energy, DF also received the balancing influence of Ras
Alhague - The Healer. This star brings an interest in spreading, investigating,
or studying methods of healing. Ras Alhague belongs to Ophiuchus, the great
healer who holds a serpent in his hands. Aligned to Mercury it symbolises the
desire to bring the knowledge of healing, and to spread this type of
information. This impetus would have reinforced the position of Mercury in the 3<sup>rd</sup>
House, called to Gather and Disseminate Information. When DF married a doctor,
Thomas Penry Evans, it brought new inner influences to the group resulting in a
five year dialogue with an inner plane Master of Medicine. This produced
ambitious plans for a healing centre employing esoteric healing at spiritual,
emotional, magical and physical levels. Although their personal plans were never
realised, the subsequent spread of holistic medicine in its many faces affirms
the veracity of this vision</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The Bow of the Argo,
Phact reappeared in conjunction with the prime years, but now in conjunction
with Mercury it carried the acid test for the eccentric and idiosyncratic mind -
posing a challenge - is this The Life of an Original Thinker</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">or just a Foolish
Mind at play? DF exemplified this dichotomy. For some of a like minded
persuasion, she is an original thinker, a lateral creative thinker, while others
see only weak minded nonsense in the same words.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Fixed Star astrology
does not employ the positions of the more recently discovered planets. But it
would be a pity to not to avail ourselves of both systems. Accordingly it is
worth looking at the influence of the transpersonal planets, Saturn, Jupiter,
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The placement of
Uranus which describes the nature of personal originality, may throw some light
on the question just posed. In DF’s natal chart, Uranus is placed in the 2nd
House bringing Humanitarian Values based on a radically different set of values
compared to others. Trined with Mars, Uranus exerted another forceful push in an
already established theme, that of Experimentation. Bringing a need for
excitement and originality this placement carries personal dynamism, the ability
to achieve under pressure, a taste for untraditional work, interests in
consciousness-raising. But its underlying theme is the freedom to experiment and
learn from experiences. Team work carries little appeal, restrictions, orders
and imposed authority produces violent opposition which can come across as
rebellious. Instead this placement brings a natural ability to come up with the
surprise factor, an angle nobody else has thought of before and the ability to
earn a living through developing an unconventional talent. This desire for
experimentation brings a natural disinclination to comply with authorities but
serves the pioneer like an invisible compass.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Uranus sextile to
Mercury confirms the same drives bringing Inventiveness and a natural ability to
integrate radical new ideas without causing grave offence or shock. It brings
the desire to understand the workings of the mind. Coupled with an instinctive
sensitivity to signals in the environment which go over the head of the average
person, this placement serves the inventive and experimental spirit, bringing a
real opportunity to be a driving force for renewal it also brings some delight
in being provocative and carries some impatience as slower minds fumble with old
concepts and ideas.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">So DF’s
originality was deeply rooted in her natal chart, it was genuine, authentic,
humanitarian and karmic. Uranus Semisquare to the S. Node is called The
Lightning Rod. As its name suggests, this is a powerful force bringing the
ability and destiny to galvanise groups, organisations and individuals into
action. The office of the Lightning Rod channels a message of inspiration or
even revolution. It naturally attracts groups and people on the fringes of
society and may even carry an element of personal extremism. Uranus Semisquare
to Saturn brings the ability to establish a bridge from the old to the new.
Called Structural Renewal,</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">this placement
offers the possibility of connecting established values and its corresponding
social structures to the seeds of an incoming but nascent current. The old has
outlived its usefulness, the new is fragile; this placement reaches back into
the past and forward into the future simultaneously.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Jupiter, the
principle of expansion is highly active in DF’s natal chart. In the 5th House
this brings Personal Expansiveness, a larger than life personality a generous
nature and professional recognition. Sextile to the Sun, the placement is called
Insight and it brings the desire to learn and communicate. This placement
reaffirms the search for personal wisdom and endows the inspired person with a
wonderful capacity for positive thinking and looking on the bright side of
things. This placement brings the need to find a mentor or wise person but at
the same time few people measure up.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Trine to the North
Node, Jupiter conveys a sense of personal destiny: this placement is called
Wisdom in Emptiness. In conjunction with Mars, Jupiter brings strong personal
character traits- considerable optimism and energy, a dynamic nature and
positive attitude to the future. It gives personal courage and a pioneering
spirit. Called Ebullience, Mars conjunct Jupiter brings a fighting spirit to
matters of philosophy and religion. It can lead to disagreements with superiors,
or a fight for justice.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In Aquarius, Jupiter
brings a natural openness towards untraditional subjects and the inevitability
of an explosive spiritual awakening. This placement is called Awaken Others. It
brings a strong orientation towards the future with an emphasis on personal
growth.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Jupiter trine Pluto
is entitled Transformation of Beliefs, something that DF did continuously making
herself open to new insights and possibilities. This placement may also bring an
obsessive need to be right, or a consuming hunger to acquire insight, both
rather exhausting for close relationships. It also brings the need to develop
considerable psychological insight which may be of benefit privately and
professionally.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Jupiter trine Neptune is called
Expansive Dreams. This collective effect is related to knowledge, the intellect
and social influence. Personally it brings a talent for marketing or selling a
dream or vision combined with a personal drive to evangelise on a social,
religious or political level. Motivated by altruistic ideals and identified with
some kind of vision or dream this placement brings transcendence of all personal
dreams.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">DF was not without
significant challenges in her life which we might review through the placement
of Saturn representing restriction and obstacle. Saturn Square the North Node is
a powerful aspect a major feature of the chart, called Old Karma, this placement
brings an aura of authority and the ability to influence the groups and
organisations. It carries a sense of responsibility towards society and gives
the qualities to effect lasting changes in its structure and personal drive can
become the channel for such structural change. This assertive placement conveys
the feeling of destiny, making the hand of fate seem to appear behind every
step.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In conjunction with
the moon, Saturn brings a placement called Self-Sufficiency</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">and endows a
responsible, dutiful and motivated person determined to live up self chosen
commitments to society through work which might involver formal relations with
the public in some way.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In the 12th House,
Saturn’s placement is called Spiritual Discipline - a challenging aspect which
makes it difficult if not impossible to achieve ambition in any traditional way,
it demands that a solid professional foundation can only be gained understanding
life's purpose. Imitating the success or ambitions of others will prove
fruitless since this placement requires the surrender of all false goals.
Success comes when status and prestige are relinquished in favour of unselfish
dedication even if this means working in a field isolated from the rest of
society.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Turning now to Neptune often called
the mystical planet, since it represents transcendence. In DF’s chart another
transpersonal influence was highly significant. Retrograde in Gemini, this
placement is called Mental Relativity. Touching a whole generation, this brings
new sensory and spiritual awareness, and greater compassion. Connected with
Gemini from 1889 to 1902, it brings the ability to develop a subtle awareness of
the nature of mind and some unusual communication talents. It also brings, ‘
Extraordinary events connected with events which render you helpless in some way
- may have a profound influence on your ideas.’ And I cannot help but be
reminded of DF’s enounter with Lilias Hamilton, the warden of Studely College
which became a pivital moment in her life.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Placed in the 9th
House, Neptune’s here is called Dreaming the Truth, it brings unusual
perception of what constitutes truth, and how people's beliefs are influenced.
This can give some talent for swaying the minds of others - particularly on a
collective level.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Neptune trine the
Moon provides many spiritual talents - working with dreams or the unconscious in
some way. This placement is called Develop Intuitive Sensitivity and it gifts a
supremely sensitive and impressionable person with a creative and caring nature
with great capacity for sympathetic and understanding,</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Neptune conjunct
Pluto is entitled Mass Vision. Though collective in effect, DF embodied its
influence at a personal level by manifesting its inherent spirituality and
creativity. She embodied a talent for dealing with the media and embraced the
many wide-ranging themes connected with the mass realisation of a collective
dream and developed all the clairvoyant powers, and abilities connected with
dreams, symbols and visualising related to this placement.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Moving finally to
Pluto’s as the significator of transformation both personal and transpersonal.
Pluto placed in 9th House is called Ideology. This placement brings strong
ideological convictions and a willingness to fight for them. It brings the
intensity and determination required to getting a difficult message across with
the psychological capacity to change other people's ideas through the power of
your own beliefs. This is the mark of a convincing and natural communicator
keenly focussed in areas of faith and belief.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In Opposition to the
Sun, Pluto here hints at difficulties in relationships. Entitled Transformation
of Identity, it suggests that there is a tendency to overwhelm others and to be
dominating even in intimate relationships. Needing a partner of equal intensity,
can bring disappointment when the idealised other does not match up in strength.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In conjunction with
the North Node, this placement brings profound upheavals and staggering
transformations which change the course of life at key times. This placement may
even bring moments of naked vulnerability to destructive forces in society, or
to the inner demons of fate and this may force ruthless decisions to ensure
survival. Entitled Survival in Extremity it may even bring archetypal memories
of death and destruction DF did indeed speak of the troubling experience of
seemingly Atlantean memories which arose as dreams at about the age of four.
Nevertheless although this placement brings a familiarity with loss it also
brings the strength to move forward and start again.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In Opposition to the
South Node, Pluto brings a fated quality, handing out a personal role at times
of great upheaval; to preside over or witness forces of change which are
completely beyond the control of normal institutions at a time when the hand of
fate crushes the safe structures in society. It brings an aura of power in your
social relationships, and an involvement in groups or organisations of a
secretive nature which exert a powerful yet hidden influence over the masses in
society. It too is called <b>Survival in Extremity. </b>It brings a fated
quality, an aura of power in social relationships, an involvement in groups or
organisations of a secretive nature which exert a powerful yet hidden influence
over the masses in society.!!</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Dion Fortune - whose
name means ‘God not Luck,’ was indeed a daughter of Fortuna. She was fated
through the stars themselves as agents in some much grander and wiser picture
beyond our limited knowing. She lived out a short life dying unexpectedly from
leukemia at 56. She might have wished to do more but what she left continued to
seed itself into a bountiful harvest as I am sure she knows. She left a complete
corpus and lived out her destiny to the very full. The initiate who incarnated
between 6<sup>th</sup> Dec 1890 and 8<sup>th</sup> Jan 1946 and became known to
us as DF chose to the path of the occultist dignifying this special calling by
stressing its service to humanity first and foremost. Nowadays, the ‘O’ word
is relegated to the historical record or to dubious intentions. In our
politically correct, democratically tuned mindset, even the term ‘esoteric’
has faded into disuse as it favours the few above the many - holistic
spirituality is now the buzz word and lofty universal goals have given way to
personal ones of well being and wholeness. Magic, or multiple definitions of it
have become so accessible that anyone and everyone is encouraged to release, ‘the
inner magician.’ But this analysis of DF’s natal chart shows clearly that
real magicians are born and not made. Nowadays much of DF’s terminology and
thinking may seem outdated to a self professed New Age audience. Yet these
anachronistic terms, quaint concepts and outdated values were the exact tools
with which she and others of like minds consciously worked across the divide
between the planes and opened the floodgates to the Age of Aquarius.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">According to Fixed
Star Astrology, the stars which belong to the later part of life summarise
achievement, indicate legacy or reputation. DF was blessed by two stars in this
period. Fittingly her life’s work was crowned by The Diadem, a symbol of
royalty. This star does not seek glory or personal fame. Aligned to Jupiter in
the chart, it brings a self-sacrificing generosity which gives unstintingly to a
cause. This stellar combination is the metaphysical equivalent of tithing, give
unselfishly and your gifts are returned a hundred fold. It is undeniably about
feminine strength. This star is the gift of the Goddess.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Finally completing
the circle of her life, the star Spica, her birth star returned and was aligned
to the Moon. In a final wonderful piece of cosmic synchronicity, the goddess of
the harvest returned to reap a rich reward. DF’s life was suspended between
the two doors of birth and death, each was guarded and gifted by the Goddess
herself.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Imagine the following scene:</font></p>
<font face="Papyrus">
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">You walk upon barren
hillside in a gently rolling landscaper. The ground is parched by heat, the
trees seem stunted by harsh winds; the ground feels hard and lifeless. You hear
the sound of singing and in the distance a figure walks alone, as she
approaches, see that she carries a wheat-sheaf nursed under one arm like a loved
child. Slung across her body is a seed bag,</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">As she walks she
broadcasts seed over the land. A breeze sprigs up and takes some whirling away
to more distant places. She approaches and you see that she wears a plain white
robe and a garland of wheat is plaited onto a simple headdress. Now she reaches
where you stand and as your eyes meet, she pauses. In this moment of shared
stillness, you may reach out and ask for a blessing on any special project
nestling deep in your heart or simply make yourself open to the seeds of
inspiration. The moment is brief, she does not stop long but continues on her
way casting good seed upon the land. You find yourself wondering what will
become of these seeds - spread in so poor a place. Bending down and touching the
earth, find a seed and take it into your own care.</font></p>
<font face="Papyrus">
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Now you are alone,
the figure has completely vanished from your sight, You begin to walk down the
hillside. The skies unexpectedly darken and warm summer rain begins to fall
softly onto the land. The rain passes almost as soon as it has begun, the skies
still remain grey in colour and there emerging from the special combination of
water and light, a double rainbow fills the sky with its twin arches. With
childlike delight, you try to see where the rainbow ends wondering where the
fabled crock of gold might be hidden. Seven lights hover over a glade of trees,
and while still wondering if this is the place of rainbows-end, you see that a
figure emerges from within the glade. No sooner has she emerged than she begins
to run, almost gliding on the air as if her feet do not quite touch the ground.
She runs effortlessly up the hill and on reaching you, she gestures with her
outstretched arm, motioning for you to look behind once more. You turn to see
that the hillside once bleak and barren is now a meadowland of spring flowers.
Trees are white with apple blossom and the ground is a riot of colour, red,
orange, yellow, blue, green, purple, indigo and violet, the gentlest and most
subtle colour of all.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">As you turn back to
her with some amazement, you now see that a single diadem of white light
radiates from her brow surrounding her presence with scintillating prismatic
colour. Now she turns and walks away down the hill, you watch her depart</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">- the sun is setting
on the distant horizon and as she finally disappears from your view it seems to
you that she has walked into the west merging with the sunset and its rays of
golden light.</font></p>
